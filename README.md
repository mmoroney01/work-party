As a person who hosted a party last night, I want to assign a cleaning task to the party guest responsible for that particular mess. (i.e., Ben Lachman spilled his drink on my hardwood floor.  I would assign him the task of mopping this up.)

As a person who hosted a party last night, I want to be able to send text messages en masse to the party guests who contributed to the mess in my home.

As a person who contributed to the mess at my friendâ€™s apartment last night, I definitely want to receive a text message summoning me back to said apartment so that I can clean up my share of the mess.
