Repo for my passion project "Work Party"

As a person who hosted a party last night, I want to assign a cleaning task to the party guest responsible for that particular mess. (i.e., Ben Lachman spilled his drink on my hardwood floor.  I would assign him the task of mopping this up.)

As a person who hosted a party last night, I want to be able to send text messages en masse to the party guests who contributed to the mess in my home, with personalized messages if I choose. (i.e., Ben Lachman would be sent a text message like: “Good day to you #{friend}, I request your presence at #{address} at 2:00 PM or your earliest convenience, whichever comes first, to #{cleaning task}.”)

As a person who contributed to the mess at my friend’s apartment last night, I definitely want to receive a text message summoning me back to said apartment so that I can clean up the mess that I made.
